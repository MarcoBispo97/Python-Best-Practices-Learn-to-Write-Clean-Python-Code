    "- Too many comments..\n",

    "# 😓 Bad Example\n",
    "# This function calculates the factorial of a number.\n",
    "# The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.\n",
    "# For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.\n",

    "        # This loop iterates through all numbers from 1 to n.\n",
    "        factorial *= i\n",
    "    # This statement multiplies the factorial by the current number.\n",
